/opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet --version      			# Verifies Puppet agent installation
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/opt/puppetlabs/bin' >> ~/.bashrc  	# Adds Puppet binary path to system PATH
source ~/.bashrc                          			# Reloads shell configuration to apply PATH changes
mkdir -p ~/puppet/manifests               			# Creates a folder for Puppet manifests
cd ~/puppet/manifests                     			# Moves into the manifests directory

nano site.pp                              			# Opens a new manifest file in nano editor


Contents of site.pp:

file { '/home/sriya/welcome.txt':         			# Creates a file at the given path
  ensure  => file,                        			# Ensures the file exists
  content => "Hello from Puppet on WSL Ubuntu!",  		# Adds this text inside the file
